### CODING CHALLENGE #2: REPORT

In this coding challenge I decided to use 1 “If” statement and 5 “if-else” statements, the “if” statement was used to output and ERROR message when the input provided by the user shows a greater value on the Diastolic category than in the Systolic category. The “if-else” statements were used one for each of the evaluation outcomes .

CATEGORY	             SYSTOLIC		         DIASTOLIC
Normal	               < 120	    and	     < 80
Elevated	             120-129  	and	     < 80
Stage 1 Hypertension	 130-139	  or	     80-89
Stage 2 Hypertension	 > 140	    or	     > 90
Hypertensive Crysis	   > 180	    and/or	 > 120

By using the logical operators (“and”) and (“or”) I was able to reduce the quantity of “If” statement required to make the program run successfully approximately by half.

An idea that I had was to implement the use of cases , but I’m not sure yet if the cases would make a more efficient way of making the program or it wont be as efficient , also the challenge was about the conditionals using as fewer if statements as possible so I didn’t change it.
